			<li>  <h1>What do we study in Computer Science Engineering?</h1>

					Computer Science Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware. Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics.

			<li>  <h1>how long does it take to become a software engineer?</h1>

					If you start your own company then about 5 seconds, you can give yourself any job title you want. If you want to work for a company then these days no one is going to hire anyone unless they have a degree or a fair amount of prior experience. So 3 or 4 years for a degree depending on where in the world you are for an entry level position. After that it will take a couple of years of experience to learn how the real world actually works rather than how they taught you in a classroom.

					Most engineering jobs will look for a degree plus 2-3 years experience as a minimum.
